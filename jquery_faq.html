<!--Under the FAQ, add 3 unordered lists like above. Each list should contain a national park name in an h3 element, and a ul of 4 facts about the park.-->
<h3>Bid Bend National Park</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>From an elevation of less than 1,800 feet along the Rio Grande to nearly 8,000 feet in the Chisos Mountains, Big Bend includes massive canyons, vast desert expanses, forested mountains, and an ever-changing river. Here you can explore one of the last remaining wild corners of the United States.</li>
        <li>The Rio Grande serves as the international boundary between the United States and Mexico. A passport is required for entry into Mexico.</li>
        <li>Big Bend National Park was authorized by Congress in 1935 to preserve and protect a representative area of the Chihuahuan Desert along the Rio Grande for the beneﬁt and enjoyment of present and future generations. The park includes rich biological and geological diversity, cultural history, recreational resources, and outstanding opportunities for bi-national protection of our shared natural and cultural heritage.</li>
        <li>In 1933, Texas established Texas Canyons State Park using 15 school sections owned by the state. Lands forfeited for non payment of taxes were quickly added and the name was changed to Big Bend State Park, and by October 1933 included about 160,000 acres. On June 20, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a bill that authorized the establishment of Big Bend National Park. On June 6, 1944 a deed for about 700,000 acres was formally presented to President Roosevelt. On June 12, 1944, Big Bend was established as a national park by Congressional Act signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It was designated an International Biosphere Reserve in 1976.</li>
    </ul>   
<h3>San Antonio Missions - National Historical Park</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>After 10,000 years, the people of South Texas found their cultures, their very lives under attack. In the early 1700s Apache raided from the north, deadly diseases traveled from Mexico, and drought lingered. Survival lay in the missions. By entering a mission, they foreswore their traditional life to become Spanish, accepting a new religion and pledging fealty to a distant and unseen king.</li>
        <li>Almost 60% of park visitors are over 45 years of age; 85% of visitor groups have at least one member from out of town; 8% are international visitors; 44% are from Texas.</li>
        <li>$3.2 million federal appropriation. Approximately $1 million in fiscal year 2007 for special projects from the National Park Service, Los Compadres (the park friends group), and Western National Parks Association (the cooperating association)</li>
        <li>When the Spanish established the San Antonio Missions, they laid the foundation for a new cultural group to emerge: the Tejano people. The missions are a representation of the shift in culture, religion, lifestyle, and people that occurred three hundred years ago. Tejanos represent that change as well. Modern Tejano culture is a result of the blend of Spanish and native cultures and distinct to South Texas.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park tells the story of our 36th President beginning with his ancestors until his final resting place on his beloved LBJ Ranch. This entire "circle of life" gives the visitor a unique perspective into one of America's most noteworthy citizens by providing the most complete picture of any American president.</li>
        <li>The President lived in his boyhood home from the age of five until his high school graduation in 1924. The home is furnished in the early to mid-1920s period and as such depicts a rural Texas lifestyle of 75 years ago.</li>
        <li>Many visitors come to the park to enjoy the beautiful wildflowers that dot the Hill Country landscape every Spring. </li>
        <li>Lyndon Johnson's grandfather and great-uncle established a cattle droving headquarters in the 1860s on land that is now part of Johnson City, Texas. Their log cabin and subsequent barns, cooler house, and windmill still stand. There is also a modern exhibit center focusing on the cattle business, early Johnson family and settlement history, and Hill Country survival. A chuckwagon and longhorn cattle round out the "cowboy" atmosphere.</li>
